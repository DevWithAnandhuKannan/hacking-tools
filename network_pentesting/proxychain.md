# Proxychains — Quick Reference

A concise, standalone guide to using **Proxychains** to route application traffic through one or more proxy servers.

---

## Overview

Proxychains intercepts standard networking calls from user-space applications (via a preloaded library) and routes those connections through proxies you list in a configuration file. The destination sees the IP of the last hop. Proxychains can also attempt to proxy DNS lookups when configured, reducing DNS leaks.

---

## Key Concepts

* **Proxy types:** `socks5`, `socks4`, `http` (note: SOCKS5 is the most flexible for arbitrary TCP traffic and remote DNS resolution).
* **Chain modes:** `strict_chain`, `dynamic_chain`, `random_chain`.

  * `strict_chain`: use proxies in exact order — fail if any hop is down.
  * `dynamic_chain`: skip dead proxies and build a working chain — more resilient.
  * `random_chain`: select proxies randomly per connection — more mixing, less predictability.
* **DNS handling:** `proxy_dns` option attempts to route DNS queries via the proxy path. True DNS protection depends on proxy support (SOCKS5 commonly supports remote DNS).

## Configuration locations

Common config file paths (may vary by distribution):

* `/etc/proxychains.conf`
* `/etc/proxychains4.conf`
* `~/.proxychains/proxychains.conf` (per-user)

Common command names:

* `proxychains <command>`
* `proxychains4 <command>`

Check which one is installed with `which proxychains` or `which proxychains4`.

## Minimal example config

```ini
# choose one mode (uncomment exactly one)
#strict_chain
dynamic_chain
#random_chain

# route DNS queries via proxies where possible
proxy_dns

[ProxyList]
# type host        port  [user pass]
socks5 127.0.0.1 9050
socks5 45.76.12.34 1080
http   203.0.113.45 3128
socks4 103.12.45.67 1080
```

---

## Common commands & tests

* Run a command through proxychains:

```bash
proxychains4 curl ifconfig.me
```

* Check DNS through proxy (example):

```bash
proxychains4 dig +short @resolver1.opendns.com myip.opendns.com
```

* Debugging: proxychains typically prints the config file it loaded and connection attempts; use that output to diagnose failures.

---

## Getting proxies

* Free public proxy lists are widely searchable but are often unreliable, slow, and potentially malicious or logging.
* For operational reliability, use trusted providers, paid proxies, or self-hosted proxies (deploy a small SOCKS5 server on a cloud VM you control).
* Always verify a proxy before trusting it: check connectivity, latency, support for remote DNS, and anonymity level.

---

## Practical tips

* Use `dynamic_chain` when proxies are unstable.
* Prefer SOCKS5 proxies for general-purpose TCP and DNS forwarding.
* Keep chains short enough to be reliable; more hops increase latency and failure surface.
* Some applications bypass `LD_PRELOAD` or use alternate network stacks; proxychains will not affect those.
* Combine proxychains with other anonymity layers (VPN, Tor) thoughtfully — avoid fragile or conflicting setups.

---

## Limitations & safety

* Any proxy that logs your connecting IP can deanonymize you. Use trusted nodes for sensitive activities.
* Proxychains is a user-space tool and cannot enforce system-wide proxying; kernel-level or system services may bypass it.
* Always follow applicable laws and terms of service.

## Quick reference: checklist before use

1. Confirm which proxychains binary and config file your system uses.
2. Select chain mode (`dynamic_chain` recommended for unstable lists).
3. Enable `proxy_dns` if your proxies support remote DNS.
4. Validate each proxy (connectivity, latency, DNS behavior).
5. Test external IP and DNS while proxied.
